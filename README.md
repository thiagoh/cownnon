# Cownnon game

The cows jump towards the cannon. The cannon must fire bombs against the animals to kill them, otherwise they are going to keep going in direction to the cannon and eventually touch the cannon, which lowers the cannon’s life. 
This game is like a tower defender but a little different because the tower is the cannon itself.

## Cannon
The cannon is in the left of the screen above a platform. The cannon can move, but there are restrictions as it can only move above the platform. The cannon can shoot several types of bombs: metal bombs and tomatoes. 
 - Metal bombs are the infinite
 - Tomatoes are larger than the metal bombs but are limited.

## Enemies
The enemies are spawned throughout the game. They move by jumping from right to left of the screen. The distance travelled by the cows (by jumping) can change based on a random factor and speed/direction of the wind. The wind’s speed combined with its direction can speed up or slow down the enemies. The wind speed and direction can change at any moment in the game.

## Lose/Win
If the enemies touch the cannon it loses some life. If the cannon’s life reach zero it is dead and the game is over.
If the cannon is able to kill all the enemies he wins the game.

## Points
The game points are calculated based on how many enemies were killed and the cannon life.
